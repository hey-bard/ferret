# What is Ferret?

A new type of exploratory search that aims to be fun, rapid, and useful.

Even been browsing through a media content site and bored out of your mind? Browsing is boring. So rather than a scrollable list, in Ferret everything's dropped in a "crate", and you get to scrounge around and discover something new!

If you know what you're looking for already, you can use the searchbar at the top to get to it quickly.
